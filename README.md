# [Full Stack E-Commerce Web Application]

Tech Stack 
* **React:** React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug. Build encapsulated components that manage their own state and then compose them to make beautiful UIâ€™s.
* **Next.js:** Next. js is a widely-used framework for building React applications that offer server-side rendering, automatic code-splitting, static exporting options, and easy production builds.
* **Node.js:** Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
* **GraphQL:** GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.
* **Apollo:** is a complete state management library for JavaScript apps. Simply write a GraphQL query, and Apollo Client will take care of requesting and caching your data, as well as updating your UI.
* **Prisma:** Prisma makes database access easy with an auto-generated and type-safe query builder that's tailored to your database schema. It provides an alternative to traditional ORMs and SQL query builders. Start with a new database or introspect an existing one to get started.

## Goals while building this project 

* Get Familiar with Next.js, Styled Components, GraphQL and Apollo
* Host it locally with Docker and use Prisma to handle the DB layer with MYSQL 
* Building and understanding a GraphQL server, GraphQL Schemas, TypeDefs & Resolvers

## Future goals for this project 

### [Seperate Git branches with different implementations]
* Create branches without Prisma and utilize both SQL and NoSQL database management systems including MYSQL and MongoDB to get comfortable using GraphQL with these different systems. 
* Create a branch that uses TypeScript
